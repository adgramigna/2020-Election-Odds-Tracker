# 2020 Election Odds Tracker
The goal of this project is to create a simple visual showing both Donald Trump and Joe Biden's odds over the course of the 2020 election year. I am hoping this will be a quick way for me to experiment with learning to create a web server.

## Methodology

1. Use historical presidential odds data to capture each candidate's odds leading up to the election.

2. Convert Gambling odds into implied probabilities and remove the bookmaker hold

3. Once data is clean, use Dash Plotly to create nice visualization, and deploy on local host

4. Style Fancy 

5. Deploy on Heroku
